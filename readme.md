# PowerShell basics

- Just like "bash" PowerShell is a command shell and scripting language , however unlike bash it
is based on Windows systems rather than linux systems.
- PowerShell offers a command-line option (powershell.exe) and an integrated scripting environment option (ISE, powershell_ise.exe)
- Stored as ".ps1" files vs bash which is sotred as ".sh" the only way to run ".ps1" is to right click and select "run with powershell"
this helps prevent accidents.
